                <h3>About Catfish Pepper soup With White Rice</h3>
                </p>
                Catfish pepper soup also known as <strong>point and kill</strong> is the most popular pepper soup in
                Nigeria.
                We also have cow tail pepper soup, Goat Meat Pepper Soup and several other recipes in Nigeria.
                I like Nigerian foods to where I find it difficult to cope in foreign environments.
                Well, I think this is justifiable; I have been making Nigerian foods right from my eleventh birthday.
                I think the first food I ever made was Nigeria Jellof Rice.
                <p>
                    <b>Why Point and Kill?</b><br />
                    Well, catfish is the most popular fish in Nigeria partly because it can easily be domesticated and
                    partly because it tastes nice in soups. In popular Nigerian bars, catfish are stocked in tanks or
                    large bowls alive. As a customer, you can choose the exact one you want, then they kill and
                    prepare it for you. So you point it out, they kill and make pepper soup out of it.
                    Hence, point and kill.

                You can cook Catfish pepper soup with white Rice using these ingredients;
                So here are the required ingredients, I used just a medium-sized catfish,
                so this is the exact size of the ingredients that I used. You can choose to increase
                or decrease depending on the number of persons you are looking to feed and the

                        Cut and Wash Catfish thoroughly with salt and boiled water of 90 degree Celsius to remove
                        slime..
